# E-Commerce Platform with Microservices

A comprehensive e-commerce solution built with modern technologies and microservices architecture, designed for scalability and high performance.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a full-stack e-commerce platform featuring:
- Product catalog with advanced search and filtering
- Real-time inventory management
- Secure payment processing with Stripe
- Order tracking and management
- Admin dashboard for analytics
- Responsive design for all devices

## Architecture

The platform uses a microservices architecture deployed on Azure:

### Microservices:
- **Product Service** - Product catalog and search
- **Order Service** - Order processing and management
- **Payment Service** - Payment processing with Stripe
- **Inventory Service** - Real-time stock management
- **User Service** - Authentication and user profiles
- **Notification Service** - Email and SMS notifications

### Frontend:
- Built with Next.js 14 and TypeScript
- State management with Redux Toolkit
- UI components with Chakra UI and Tailwind CSS
- Server-side rendering for SEO
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities

### Backend:
- .NET Core 8 microservices
- RESTful APIs with Swagger documentation
- Entity Framework Core for data access
- Redis for caching
- RabbitMQ for message queuing

### Infrastructure:
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for container orchestration
- Azure SQL Database for relational data
- Azure Blob Storage for images
- Azure Application Insights for monitoring
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Key Features

### 1. Advanced Product Search

```typescript
// Product search with filters
const searchProducts = async (query: string, filters: ProductFilters) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/products/search', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ query, filters }),
  });
  return response.json();
};
```

### 2. Real-Time Inventory

```csharp
// Inventory service with SignalR
public class InventoryHub : Hub
{
    public async Task UpdateStock(string productId, int quantity)
    {
        await _inventoryService.UpdateStockAsync(productId, quantity);
        await Clients.All.SendAsync("StockUpdated", productId, quantity);
    }
}
```

### 3. Payment Processing

Integrated Stripe for secure payment processing:

```typescript
const processPayment = async (paymentIntent: string) => {
  const stripe = await loadStripe(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_KEY!);
  const { error } = await stripe!.confirmPayment({
    clientSecret: paymentIntent,
    confirmParams: {
      return_url: `${window.location.origin}/order/success`,
    },
  });
  
  if (error) {
    throw new Error(error.message);
  }
};
```

## Performance Optimizations

- **Caching**: Redis for product catalog and user sessions
- **CDN**: Azure CDN for static assets
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component with WebP
- **Code Splitting**: Dynamic imports for route-based splitting
- **Database Indexing**: Optimized queries with proper indexes

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Distributed Transactions
**Solution**: Implemented the Saga pattern for managing distributed transactions across microservices.

### Challenge 2: Inventory Synchronization
**Solution**: Used event-driven architecture with RabbitMQ to ensure real-time inventory updates across services.

### Challenge 3: Scalability
**Solution**: Deployed on Kubernetes with horizontal pod autoscaling based on CPU and memory metrics.

## Results

- **99.9% uptime** in production
- **50ms average API response time**
- **Handles 10,000+ concurrent users**
- **Processed 100,000+ orders** in the first year
- **4.8/5 customer satisfaction** rating

## Deployment

The application is deployed using GitHub Actions:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy to AKS
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Build and push Docker images
        run: |
          docker build -t myregistry.azurecr.io/frontend:${{ github.sha }} ./frontend
          docker push myregistry.azurecr.io/frontend:${{ github.sha }}
      - name: Deploy to AKS
        uses: azure/k8s-deploy@v1
        with:
          manifests: |
            k8s/deployment.yml
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Microservices Complexity**: While microservices provide scalability, they add operational complexity. Proper monitoring and logging are essential.

2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Using message queues for service communication improves resilience and scalability.

3. **Cloud-Native Design**: Leveraging cloud services like Azure reduces infrastructure management overhead.

4. **API Gateway**: Implementing an API gateway simplified client-side code and improved security.

## Future Enhancements

- AI-powered product recommendations
- Mobile app with React Native
- Multi-currency and multi-language support
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Social commerce integration
