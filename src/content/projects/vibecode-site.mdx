## Project Overview

This website serves as my primary demonstration of integrating cutting-edge frontend technologies to deliver a high-performance, visually striking user experience. The main challenge was integrating React Three Fiber's complex 3D rendering with Next.js's server-side rendering capabilities and Chakra UI's styling system.
