# Building Modern Web Apps with Next.js 14

Next.js 14 brings exciting new features that make building modern web applications faster and more efficient than ever before. In this post, we'll explore the key improvements and how to leverage them in your projects.

## Server Actions

Server Actions are one of the most powerful features in Next.js 14. They allow you to write server-side logic directly in your components without creating API routes.

```typescript
'use server'

export async function createPost(formData: FormData) {
  const title = formData.get('title');
  const content = formData.get('content');
  
  // Save to database
  await db.posts.create({
    data: { title, content }
  });
  
  revalidatePath('/blog');
}
```

## Partial Prerendering

Partial Prerendering (PPR) is a new rendering strategy that combines the benefits of static and dynamic rendering. It allows you to have a static shell with dynamic content holes.

### Benefits of PPR:
- Faster initial page loads
- Better SEO
- Dynamic content where needed
- Reduced server load

## Performance Improvements

Next.js 14 includes significant performance improvements:

1. **Faster Local Server Startup** - 53% faster
2. **Faster Code Changes** - 96% faster HMR
3. **Reduced Memory Usage** - 60% less memory

## Image Optimization

The Image component has been enhanced with better performance and developer experience:

```jsx
import Image from 'next/image';

export function Hero() {
  return (
    <Image
      src="/hero.jpg"
      alt="Hero image"
      width={1200}
      height={600}
      priority
      placeholder="blur"
    />
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

Next.js 14 represents a significant step forward in web development. The combination of Server Actions, Partial Prerendering, and performance improvements makes it an excellent choice for modern web applications.
